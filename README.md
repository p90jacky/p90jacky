- 👋 Hi, I’m @p90jacky
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and the insights that it could provide into science and business, how it can be used to optimize best practices, 
- and to improve what the world is working towards.
-
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python in the context of data science and numerical modelling in chemistry and chemical physics, with an open mind to new projects as they come up.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that would allow me to gain valuable experience and insight into the data science world, experience in modeling chemical reactions and reactivity, and generally cool science tangent projects that can unite math and the real world!
